# Notes on Box Model
Margin is the outer space around the border
Use margin to distance buttons and boxes from each other
Using padding is better compared to using height and width to size buttons (And boxes)
When creating rounded buttons when using padding to set height and width, set border-radius to double the top and bottom padding px value
